# XLingPaper-Annotated-Bibliography

This is a rough (but distributable) list of works created using XLingPaper. It is intended to
be circulated for comment and feedback. It is a draft section of another work which looks at
XLingPaper in more depth. If you are an author who has used XLingPaper please consider adding

## Contributing

Contributions via Github can occur as pull requests. Alternatively email Hugh Paterson III a
reference to be added in an XLingPaper document (an item within a XLingPaper `References` section is sufficient.
So that he can copy and paste into the existing document). Structural changes to the bibliography
will be considered based on user feedback.

## Purpose

This is the start of an annotated bibliography of works created using [XLingPaper](https://software.sil.org/xlingpaper/). XLingPaper
has been around since 2001 and has been the tool of choice for those who have sought solutions
beyond the performance or limits of: MS Word, TeX, Markdown, OpenOffice, Pages, Pandoc,
Scrivener and a variety of other tools. The scope of the bibliography is comprehensive—if it
was built with XLingPaper. The purpose of this bibliography is to use XLingPaper to create a
document which will help tool users identify how XLingPaper has been used to create works
like they might want to create — to exemplify the diverse utility of XLingPaper. Therefore the
annotations note the unique typography, document structure, and content formats rather than any
_linguistic_ features, argumentation, or theory. To date the primary academic discourse presenting
XLingPaper has been published as Simons & Black (2008), Black (2009), Black & Black (2012).
